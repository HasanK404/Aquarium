# üê† Virtual Aquarium with Fish Behaviour

This project is an interactive **virtual aquarium** built in **Processing (Java)**.  
It demonstrates object-oriented programming, real-time graphics, and autonomous fish behaviour that responds dynamically to user input.  
The simulation features animated fish, environmental lighting, and realistic motion physics to create a visually engaging digital aquarium experience.

## ‚ú® Features
- 15+ fish objects that wander naturally with random motion  
- Smooth wall avoidance to prevent fish from leaving the tank  
- Fish react to the **mouse cursor** (predator effect)  
- **Left-click** to drop food particles ‚Äî fish detect and eat them  
- **Day/Night toggle** with animated ambient lighting  
- **Hunger system** that changes fish colour and swim speed  
- On-screen **UI** showing fish count, food count, FPS, and controls

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Open the project folder in the **Processing IDE**.  
2. Run the main file: `Aquarium.pde`.  
3. Interact with the aquarium using your **mouse** and **keyboard**.
